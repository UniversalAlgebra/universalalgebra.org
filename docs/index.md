# Welcome to Universal Algebra .org

This site is dedicated to exploring topics in universal algebra, with an initial focus on one of its most significant open problems: the **Finite Lattice Representation Problem (FLRP)**.

## Main Goals of the Site

1.  To provide a clear, modern, and accessible resource for understanding complex problems in universal algebra.

2.  To document ongoing research, new ideas, and progress towards solving these problems.

## Featured Research: The FLRP

The first major section of this site is a deep dive into the FLRP. It explores the problem's history, core concepts, current status, and the sophisticated tools being used to tackle it.
