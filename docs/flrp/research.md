# Current & Future Research

The Finite Lattice Representation Problem remains a vital open question. Its resolution would significantly impact our understanding of finite algebraic structures. This section recaps its importance and outlines promising avenues for future research, including current work on finding a counterexample.

### Potential Avenues for Future Research

* **Refining TCT Applications:** Developing more explicit ways Tame Congruence Theory can rule out candidate lattices.
* **New Constructive Techniques:** Searching for novel methods to build finite algebras for specific lattice structures.
* **Identifying "Forbidden Substructures":** Searching for lattice configurations inherently non-representable by finite algebras.
* **Investigating Problem Variations:** Examining restricted versions of FLRP (e.g., for specific algebra types or varieties).

### Our Approach: Finding a Counterexample

The prevailing conjecture is that the FLRP is false, meaning a counterexample must exist. Our current research focuses on two promising theoretical frameworks for identifying such a counterexample.

#### 1. The Tame Congruence Theory (TCT) Approach
As detailed on the TCT page, this theory provides a powerful "no-go" framework. The strategy is to analyze the structural requirements TCT imposes on a congruence lattice. If a candidate lattice, such as L7, implies a local configuration of the five TCT types that is proven to be impossible within a single finite algebra, then L7 would be confirmed as a non-representable counterexample.

#### 2. The Interval Enforceable Properties Approach
Our paper on ["Interval Enforceable Properties"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1927) proposes another "no-go" strategy from the group-theoretic perspective, building on the Pálfy-Pudlák theorem.  The core idea is to identify properties of lattices that, if they were to appear as an interval $[H, G]$ in a subgroup lattice, would enforce strong, verifiable conditions on the structure of the finite group $G$.
