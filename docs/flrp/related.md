# Partial Results & Related Problems

While the general FLRP remains open, significant progress has been made on special cases and related questions.

### Known Representable Classes
Certain classes of finite lattices are known to be representable by finite algebras. These partial victories help delineate the boundary of the problem.

* **Finite Distributive Lattices:** This was the first major result, proven by Dilworth.
* **Lattices with No Three-Element Antichains:** A result from J. Snow (2000).

### The Congruence Lattice Problem (CLP)
It's crucial to distinguish the FLRP from the related, but now solved, **Congruence Lattice Problem (CLP)**.

* **CLP asked:** Is every *distributive algebraic lattice* (possibly infinite) the congruence lattice of some *lattice* (possibly infinite)?
* **Status:** Solved **negatively** by Friedrich Wehrung in 2007.

The negative solution to the CLP serves as an important precedent, showing that not all "reasonable" representation questions in lattice theory have a positive answer. However, because it deals with infinite structures and a restricted class of representing algebras (lattices only), it does not directly solve the FLRP.
