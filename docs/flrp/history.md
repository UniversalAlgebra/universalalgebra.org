# History and Key Milestones

The FLRP is built upon a rich history of research. Here are the key developments that led to the problem and have shaped its study.

| Year          | Key Figure(s)               | Contribution                                                                                                     |

| **c. 1940** | R. P. Dilworth              | Proved every finite *distributive* lattice is the congruence lattice of a finite lattice.                          |
| **1948** | G. Birkhoff & O. Frink      | Established that $\text{Con } \mathbf{A}$ of any algebra $\mathbf{A}$ is an algebraic lattice.                           |
| **1963** | G. Grätzer & E. T. Schmidt  | Proved that every *algebraic* lattice is $\text{Con } \mathbf{A}$ for some (possibly infinite) algebra. This set the stage for the FLRP. |
| **1980** | P. Pudlák & J. Tůma         | Showed every finite lattice can be embedded into the lattice of all equivalence relations on a finite set.         |
| **1980** | P. P. Pálfy & P. Pudlák     | **The Pálfy-Pudlák Theorem**: Proved the FLRP is equivalent to a problem in finite group theory.                   |
| **1980s-Present** | DeMeo, Freese, Hobby, Jipsen, McKenzie, Snow, et al. | Development of Tame Congruence Theory; computational algebra approaches; focused search for counterexamples. |
| **2007** | F. Wehrung                  | Solved the related (but infinite) Congruence Lattice Problem (CLP) negatively.                                   |

## The Pálfy-Pudlák Theorem: A Game-Changing Equivalence

The 1980 theorem by Pálfy and Pudlák was a watershed moment. It transformed the problem by providing a powerful, if equally difficult, alternative formulation:

> A finite lattice $L$ is representable as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra **if and only if** $L$ is isomorphic to an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group.

This connected the abstract problem of congruence lattices to the concrete world of finite group theory, opening up entirely new avenues of attack.
