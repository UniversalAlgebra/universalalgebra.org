# Tame Congruence Theory (TCT)

One of the most powerful tools brought to bear on the FLRP is **Tame Congruence Theory**, developed by David Hobby and Ralph McKenzie in their 1988 monograph, "The Structure of Finite Algebras."

TCT provides a deep, structural analysis of finite algebras by examining the "local" behavior of their congruence lattices.

### The Core Idea of TCT
TCT asserts that the structure of a finite algebra is profoundly constrained by the structure of its congruence lattice. It classifies the prime intervals in any congruence lattice into one of five types, revealing the "local flavor" of the algebra in that region.

### The Five Types
Every local neighborhood in a finite algebra behaves (is "polynomially equivalent" to) one of five fundamental types of minimal algebras:

1.  **Unary Type (Type 1):** Behaves like a set with a group of permutations acting on it.
2.  **Affine Type (Type 2):** Behaves like a vector space.
3.  **Boolean Type (Type 3):** Behaves like a two-element Boolean algebra.
4.  **Lattice Type (Type 4):** Behaves like a two-element lattice.
5.  **Semilattice Type (Type 5):** Behaves like a two-element semilattice.

### Relevance to FLRP
TCT provides a strong set of necessary conditions that a finite lattice must satisfy if it is to be a congruence lattice. If a candidate lattice (like L7) would force a configuration of these five types that is forbidden by the general theory of TCT, then that lattice cannot be represented by any finite algebra. TCT provides a powerful "no-go" framework for ruling out potential candidates.
