# The Finite Lattice Representation Problem (FLRP)

The [Finite Lattice Representation Problem][FLRP Wikipedia page] is a central, long-standing unsolved question in universal algebra. At its heart, it asks something fundamental about the nature of finite mathematical structures:

> **Is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra?**

This section breaks down this complex problem into digestible parts. We will explore its origins, the key mathematical concepts involved, the pivotal theorems that have shaped its study, and the current frontiers of research as we search for a solution.
