<h2 id="1-the-finite-lattice-representation-problem-context-and-demeos-framework">1. The Finite Lattice Representation Problem: Context and DeMeo's Framework</h2>
<p>This section establishes the foundational context of the Finite Lattice
Representation Problem (FLRP) and meticulously dissects DeMeo's contributions [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>],
highlighting the mechanisms relevant to the proposed combined strategy.</p>
<h3 id="11-brief-recapitulation-of-the-flrp-and-the-palfy-pudlak-theorem">1.1. Brief Recapitulation of the FLRP and the Pálfy-Pudlák Theorem</h3>
<p>The Finite Lattice Representation Problem (FLRP) stands as a central open question in
universal algebra, asking for a characterization of those finite lattices that are
isomorphic to the congruence lattices of finite algebras.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] The study of congruence
lattices, which encode the homomorphic images and internal symmetries of algebraic
structures, is fundamental to understanding the structure of algebras themselves.</p>
<p>A pivotal result connecting this problem to group theory is the Pálfy-Pudlák
Theorem. This theorem states two equivalent conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) Every finite lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite
   algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> (denoted <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span>).</li>
<li>(B) Every finite lattice is isomorphic to an interval in the subgroup lattice of
   some finite group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> (denoted <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span>, representing the lattice of subgroups of G
   containing <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> and contained in <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The equivalence (A) ⟺ (B) implies that if one can find a finite lattice L for which
it can be proven that no finite group G exists such that L ≅ [H, G] for some subgroup
H of G, then it would follow that statement (A) is false, and the FLRP would have a
negative answer. This theorem, therefore, transforms a problem in universal algebra
and lattice theory into a problem concerning the structure of subgroup lattices of
finite groups, providing the primary motivation for the approach detailed in
DeMeo.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] The strategic importance of this connection cannot be
overstated, as it opens a pathway to addressing the FLRP through group-theoretic
constructions and arguments.</p>
<h3 id="12-core-free-interval-enforceable-cf-ie-properties-definitions-and-significance">1.2. Core-Free Interval Enforceable (cf-IE) Properties: Definitions and Significance</h3>
<p>Building upon the Pálfy-Pudlák theorem, DeMeo [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] introduces a
classification of group-theoretic properties based on their relationship to lattice
intervals. An "interval enforceable (IE)" property <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is a group property for which
there exists a finite lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> such that if <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> is a group with <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> isomorphic to an
interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> in its subgroup lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Sub}(G)\)</span>, then <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must possess property <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>A more refined and crucial concept for the FLRP is that of "core-free interval
enforceable (cf-IE)" properties.  A property <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> is cf-IE if there exists a finite
lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> such that if <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> is a group with <span class="arithmatex">\(L ≅ [H, G]\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a core-free
subgroup of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> (i.e., <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{core}_G(H) = 1\)</span>, meaning <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> contains no non-trivial
normal subgroup of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>), then <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must possess property <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span>.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]</p>
<p>The core-free condition, <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{core}_G(H) = 1\)</span>, is of paramount significance. 
When <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is core-free in <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>, the group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> admits a faithful permutation
representation <span class="arithmatex">\(ϕ\)</span> on the set of right cosets <span class="arithmatex">\(G/H\)</span>. It is a well-established result
that the congruence lattice of the algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(⟨G/H, ϕ(G)⟩\)</span> (formed by the <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>-set <span class="arithmatex">\(G/H\)</span>
with the action of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>) is isomorphic to the interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Sub}(G)\)</span>. </p>
<p>This isomorphism is the critical link: it means that a core-free interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span>
<em>is</em> the congruence lattice of a specific finite algebra derived directly from the
group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> and subgroup <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span>. Consequently, cf-IE properties are group properties that are
forced upon <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> when a particular lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> appears as the congruence lattice of such a
<span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>-set. This directly connects the study of subgroup intervals under the core-free
condition to statement (A) of the Pálfy-Pudlák theorem, making cf-IE properties
particularly potent tools for investigating the FLRP. Without the core-free
assumption, the interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> might not directly correspond to a congruence lattice
of an algebra naturally derived from <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> in a way that is immediately relevant to the
FLRP as formulated by Pálfy and Pudlák.</p>
<p>DeMeo [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] provides several examples of cf-IE properties. Insolubility
is shown to be IE (and therefore cf-IE), while solubility is demonstrated to be not
even cf-IE.  Other identified cf-IE classes of groups include those that
are not alternating or symmetric groups, subdirectly irreducible groups, groups
possessing no non-trivial abelian normal subgroups, and groups <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> for which the
centralizer <span class="arithmatex">\(C_G(M)\)</span> is trivial for every non-trivial normal subgroup <span class="arithmatex">\(M\)</span> of
<span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>. These examples underscore that cf-IE properties can be substantial and
non-trivial, offering a way to impose strong structural constraints on groups based
on the lattice-theoretic structure of their subgroup intervals.</p>
<h3 id="13-strategic-importance-of-thm-36-and-the-parachute-construction-for-flrp">1.3. Strategic Importance of Thm 3.6 and the Parachute Construction for FLRP</h3>
<p>A cornerstone of DeMeo's proposed strategy for the FLRP is Theorem 3.6 of
[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]. This theorem establishes further equivalences to statement (B)
of the Pálfy-Pudlák theorem (and thus to a positive answer to the FLRP). Among these,
statement (C) is particularly relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>(C) For every finite lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span>, for every finite collection <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="arithmatex">\(X_n\)</span> of
   cf-IE classes of groups, there exists a finite group <span class="arithmatex">\(G ∈ ⋂ \{X_i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n\}\)</span>
   such that <span class="arithmatex">\(L ≅ [H, G]\)</span> for some subgroup <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> that is core-free in <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategic implication of Theorem 3.6 (C) is profound: if one could identify a
finite collection of cf-IE classes of groups, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="arithmatex">\(X_n\)</span>, whose intersection is
empty (i.e., no finite group can simultaneously possess all these properties), then
statement (C) would be false for any choice of <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span>. This, in turn, would imply that
statement (B) of the Pálfy-Pudlák theorem is false, leading to a negative resolution
of the FLRP.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] This transforms the FLRP into a concrete
group-theoretic problem: the search for a set of mutually incompatible cf-IE
properties.</p>
<p>The "parachute lattice" construction, denoted <span class="arithmatex">\(P(L, L_1, ..., L_n)\)</span> and illustrated in
Figure 4 of [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>], is a key technical device used in proving the
equivalence (B) ⟹ (C). This construction involves creating a new lattice P from a given
lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> and a set of lattices <span class="arithmatex">\(L_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="arithmatex">\(L_n\)</span> (where each <span class="arithmatex">\(L_i\)</span> is known to
enforce a cf-IE property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_i\)</span>). If statement (B) holds, then <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> must be
representable as a core-free interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> for some group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>.  The structure of
the parachute lattice then ensures that the sub-intervals within <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span>
corresponding to <span class="arithmatex">\(L_i\)</span> are also core-free intervals
isomorphic to <span class="arithmatex">\(L_i\)</span>. Consequently, G must possess each property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_i\)</span>, placing <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> in the
intersection <span class="arithmatex">\(⋂ P_i\)</span>. The parachute lattice, therefore, serves as a conceptual blueprint
for how multiple cf-IE constraints could be simultaneously imposed on a single group
<span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>, should the FLRP have a positive answer. The failure to find such a group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>, under
increasingly restrictive (yet valid) cf-IE conditions, would provide evidence against
the FLRP.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Corollary 3.9 of [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>], which follows from the parachute
construction logic, states that the conjunction of any finite number of cf-IE
properties is itself a cf-IE property. This reinforces the strategy of accumulating
multiple cf-IE properties with the aim of reaching a contradiction (an empty
intersection).</p>
<h3 id="14-illustrative-example-insights-from-the-analysis-of-l_7">1.4. Illustrative Example: Insights from the Analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span></h3>
<p>DeMeo's paper provides a compelling illustration of this strategy through a detailed
analysis of a specific seven-element lattice, denoted <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>. This lattice is notable as
it is the smallest for which a congruence lattice representation 
(<span class="arithmatex">\(L_7 ≅ \mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> for some finite algebra A) has not yet been found.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]</p>
<p>Proposition 4.1 of [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] outlines a set of strong group-theoretic
properties that any finite group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must possess if <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> is isomorphic to a core-free
interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Sub}(G)\)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must be a primitive permutation group (derived from the core-freeness of a
    maximal subgroup <span class="arithmatex">\(K\)</span> corresponding to an element in <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any non-trivial normal subgroup <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>, its centralizer <span class="arithmatex">\(C_G(N)\)</span> must be
    trivial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> can contain no non-trivial abelian normal subgroups (a direct consequence of
    the trivial centralizer property).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must be insoluble (also a consequence of the trivial centralizer property for minimal normal subgroups).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> must be subdirectly irreducible (possessing a unique minimal normal subgroup).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the possible exception of at most one maximal subgroup in the interval 
    <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span>, all proper subgroups within this interval must be core-free in <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for DeMeo's general
strategy. It demonstrates that even a relatively small and specific lattice structure
can impose a formidable list of cf-IE properties on any group <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> that might represent
it as a core-free interval. These derived properties significantly narrow the class
of potential candidate groups <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>. The internal structure of the lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>
itself---its specific configuration of meets, joins, and elements like the
non-modular element K [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]---is what drives the deduction of these
group properties, often in conjunction with group-theoretic tools like Dedekind's
rule and Lemma 3.5 (concerning permuting subgroups).[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] This
highlights that a deep understanding of how lattice-theoretic features translate into
cf-IE properties is essential. The techniques employed in the <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> analysis may
prove adaptable when considering new enforceable properties derived from Tame
Congruence Theory.</p>
<h2 id="2-tame-congruence-theory-a-structural-lens-for-finite-algebras">2. Tame Congruence Theory: A Structural Lens for Finite Algebras</h2>
<p>Tame Congruence Theory (TCT), primarily developed by David Hobby and Ralph McKenzie
[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>], offers a sophisticated framework for analyzing the structure of
finite algebras by examining the local behavior of their congruence lattices. This
theory provides the conceptual tools for potentially defining new and powerful
enforceable properties relevant to the FLRP.</p>
<h3 id="21-fundamental-concepts">2.1. Fundamental Concepts.</h3>
<p>The fundamental concepts of TCT are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal algebras;</li>
<li>the five TCT types;</li>
<li>(α, β)-minimal sets (traces, body, tail);</li>
<li>labeled congruence lattices.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of TCT is the analysis of prime quotients α ≺ β (meaning α is covered by
β) in the congruence lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> of a finite algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span>.  The local
behavior of the algebra in the "vicinity" of such a quotient is captured by
<em>(α, β)-minimal sets</em>. </p>
<p>An <strong>(α, β)-minimal set</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span> is the range of an idempotent unary polynomial <span class="arithmatex">\(e\)</span> of
<span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span>, minimal with respect to the property that the restrictions <span class="arithmatex">\(α∣_U\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(β∣_U\)</span> are
different.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]</p>
<p>Within an (α, β)-minimal set <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span>, certain <span class="arithmatex">\(β∣_U\)</span>-classes, known as <strong>traces</strong>, are
particularly important; these are the <span class="arithmatex">\(β∣_U\)</span>-classes that are not contained in a single
<span class="arithmatex">\(α∣_U\)</span>​-class. The union of all traces in <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span> forms the <strong>body</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span> of <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span>. The remaining
part, <span class="arithmatex">\(T = U - B\)</span>, is called the <strong>tail</strong>.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]  TCT provides a rich
structural understanding of the body, while the tail is considered less structured or
"wild" from the theory's perspective.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]</p>
<p>A key discovery of TCT is that the algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A∣_N\)</span> (the operations of <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> restricted
to <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> is a trace), when factored by the restricted congruence <span class="arithmatex">\(α∣_N\)</span>, is
polynomially equivalent to one of precisely five types of <em>minimal algebras</em>.[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>]</p>
<p>A <strong>minimal algebra</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(M\)</span> is a finite algebra with at least two elements in which every
non-constant unary polynomial is a permutation of its domain.[<a href="#works-cited">5</a>]</p>
<p>The five TCT types (of minimal algebras) are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Type 1 (Unary)</em>: pol-equiv to a <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>-set.</li>
<li><em>Type 2 (Affine)</em>: pol-equiv to a vector space over a finite field.</li>
<li><em>Type 3 (Boolean)</em>: pol-equiv to the two-element Boolean algebra.</li>
<li><em>Type 4 (Lattice)</em>: pol-equiv to the two-element lattice.</li>
<li><em>Type 5 (Semilattice)</em>: pol-equiv to the two-element semilattice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This classification allows each prime quotient α ≺ β in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> to be
assigned one of these five types, transforming <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> into a <strong>labeled congruence lattice</strong>.2 This
labeling provides a "local flavor" for the algebra at each prime quotient.</p>
<p>The connection to DeMeo's framework arises when considering the algebra 
<span class="arithmatex">\(A_G = ⟨G/H, ϕ(G)⟩\)</span>, whose congruence lattice is isomorphic to the interval <span class="arithmatex">\([H, G]\)</span> when <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is
core-free.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] Thus, a TCT analysis of a lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span>, when <span class="arithmatex">\(L ≅ [H, G]\)</span>, is
effectively a TCT analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>. The TCT types observed in <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> 
(as <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>) become fundamental characteristics. The challenge and
opportunity lie in translating these type-dependent properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> back into
group-theoretic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> that can be classified as cf-IE.</p>

highlighting the core algebraic structure and polynomial characteristics associated
with each local type. This is crucial for understanding how TCT might define

<p>TCT reveals deep connections between the local types present in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> and global
properties of the algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> and the variety <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A)\)</span> it generates. A variety is a class
of algebras closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras, and direct products.
(Alternatively, and equivalently, according to Birkhoff's HSP Theorem, a variety is
an <em>equational class</em> of algebras.)</p>
<p><strong>Omitting Types and Malt'sev Conditions</strong>. A particularly powerful aspect of TCT is
the characterization of varieties that omit certain sets of types. Such omissions are
often equivalent to the variety satisfying specific Malt'sev conditions, which are
sets of term identities.[<a href="#works-cited">6</a>] For locally finite varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Omitting <strong>type 1</strong> (unary type) is equivalent to the variety being a 
   <strong>Taylor variety</strong>, i.e., possessing a Taylor term. A Taylor term is an idempotent
   term <span class="arithmatex">\(t(x_1, ..., x_n)\)</span> such that for each <span class="arithmatex">\(i ∈ \{1, ..., n\}\)</span>, </li>
</ul>
<p>[t(x, ..., x, y, x, ..., x) = t(x, ..., x, z, x, ..., x)]</p>
<p>holds if <span class="arithmatex">\(y\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(z\)</span> are in the <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span>-th position and all other variables are <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span>.[<a href="#works-cited">6</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li>Omitting <strong>types {1, 5}</strong> (unary and semilattice types) is equivalent to the
   variety satisfying a <strong>non-trivial congruence identity</strong> and possessing a
   Hobby-McKenzie term.[<a href="#works-cited">6</a>]</li>
<li>Omitting <strong>types {1, 2}</strong> (unary and affine types) is equivalent to the variety
   being <strong>congruence meet-semidistributive</strong> (SD(∧)).[<a href="#works-cited">6</a>]</li>
<li>Omitting <strong>types {1, 2, 5}</strong> (unary, affine, and semilattice types) is equivalent
   to the variety being <strong>congruence join-semidistributive</strong> (SD(∨)).[<a href="#works-cited">6</a>]</li>
<li>A variety is <strong>congruence modular</strong> if and only if its type set is contained in
   {2, 3, 4} and all its minimal sets have empty tails.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]</li>
<li>A variety is <strong>congruence distributive</strong> if and only if its type set is contained
   in {3, 4} and all its minimal sets have empty tails.[<a href="#works-cited">10</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>These equivalences provide a pathway: if the structure of a lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span> (as <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>) forces the omission or presence of certain TCT types in <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>, then <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (or <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span>) must satisfy corresponding strong algebraic conditions. The primary challenge, then, is to translate these algebraic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (e.g., "possesses a Taylor term") into meaningful group-theoretic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> that can be shown to be cf-IE.</p>
<p><strong>Solvability and Abelianness:</strong> Commutator theory for congruences defines notions of
solvable and abelian congruences. A prime quotient α ≺ β is <strong>abelian</strong> if the
commutator [β, β] is less than or equal to α. An interval I[δ, θ] is <strong>solvable</strong> if
it has a finite chain of congruences δ = γ0 ≺ γ1 ≺ ⋯ ≺ γk = θ such that each factor
I[γi, γi+1] is abelian.[<a href="#works-cited">12</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li>Prime quotients of <strong>type 2</strong> (affine) are always abelian.[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>]</li>
<li>Prime quotients of <strong>type 1</strong> (unary) can be either abelian or non-abelian.[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>]</li>
<li>If an interval I[δ, θ] is solvable, then all its prime factors must be of type 1
   or type 2 [<a href="#works-cited">2</a> (Theorem 7.12)].  This connection is significant because if a lattice
   <span class="arithmatex">\(L\)</span>, when represented as <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>, forces certain intervals to be solvable or certain
   quotients to be abelian (or non-abelian), this imposes strict TCT type constraints
   on <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>.</li>

<h3 id="23-the-notion-of-tameness-and-the-significance-of-empty-tails-in-minimal-sets">2.3. The Notion of "Tameness" and the Significance of "Empty Tails" in Minimal Sets</h3>
<p>The term "tame" in TCT broadly refers to the well-behaved, structured nature of local
polynomial operations, particularly on the <strong>body</strong> of an (α, β)-minimal set <span class="arithmatex">\(U\)</span>. TCT
provides extensive information about the structure induced on the body <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>. In
contrast, the <strong>tail</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(T = U - B\)</span> is often described as "wild," meaning TCT offers
very little structural insight into it.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]</p>
<p>The condition that minimal sets have <strong>empty tails</strong> (T = ∅, so U = B) is highly
significant. When tails are empty, the local structure is fully "tame," and the
analytical power of TCT can be most effectively applied.3 The presence of non-empty
tails, especially for types 1 or 5, is intrinsically linked to failures of congruence
modularity. For instance, if a minimal set of type i ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} has a non-empty
tail, it forces the existence of a pentagonal sublattice N5 (a hallmark of
non-modularity) of type i in the congruence lattice of some subalgebra of A2.3
Conversely, strong conditions on the labeled congruence lattice, such as the absence
of such pentagons, can force tails to be empty.[<a href="#works-cited">3</a>]</p>
<p>For a locally finite variety V to be <strong>congruence modular</strong>, two conditions must be
met: its type set must be restricted to {2,3,4} (i.e., types 1 and 5 must be
omitted), AND all minimal sets associated with these types must have empty tails.3
The "empty tails" condition is thus a critical component of "tameness" in the context
of well-behaved varieties like congruence modular ones. If a lattice L, interpreted
as <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>, were to force <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> to have minimal sets with non-empty tails of type 1 or
5, this would indicate a certain "wildness" in <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> and imply that <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> is not
congruence modular. Such "wildness," if translatable into a group-theoretic property,
could be a candidate for a cf-IE property. The challenge remains in formalizing
"wildness" (e.g., non-empty tails of specific types) as an algebraic property of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>
that subsequently translates into a cf-IE group property of G.</p>
<h2 id="3-defining-enforceable-properties-via-tame-congruence-theory">3. Defining Enforceable Properties via Tame Congruence Theory</h2>
<p>This section explores concrete ways TCT concepts can be harnessed to define new cf-IE
group properties, focusing on the crucial step of translating properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>
or the algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> itself into properties of the group G.</p>
<h3 id="31-leveraging-tct-types-proposing-cf-ie-properties-based-on-the-presence-or-omission-of-specific-tct-types-or-type-configurations-in-mathrmcona_g">3.1. Leveraging TCT Types: Proposing cf-IE properties based on the presence or omission of specific TCT types or type configurations in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>.</h3>
<p>A primary avenue for defining new enforceable properties through TCT involves the set
of types present in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> (which is isomorphic to the interval L ≅ [H, G] when H is core-free).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Properties Based on Type Omission</strong>. If a lattice L, by its structure, forces any
   algebra A for which <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A) ≅ L\)</span> to omit certain TCT types from its type set (or
   from the type set of the variety V(A) it generates), this leads to strong
   algebraic consequences. For instance:</li>
<li>If L forces <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> to omit <strong>type 1</strong> (unary type), then <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> must possess a Taylor term, and <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> is a Taylor variety.6</li>
<li>If L forces <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> to omit <strong>types {1,5}</strong> (unary and semilattice types), then
       <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> must satisfy a non-trivial congruence identity and possess a Hobby-McKenzie
       term.6 The critical step is then to determine if "G is a group such that <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>
       has a Taylor term (or satisfies a given congruence identity)" can be
       established as a cf-IE property of G, meaning it is enforceable by some
       (potentially different) lattice L′. This translation from an algebraic
       property of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> to a cf-IE group property of G represents a significant
       theoretical challenge. </li>
<li><strong>Properties Based on Type Presence</strong>. Conversely, if the structure of L forces
   <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> to exhibit certain TCT types, this can also lead to enforceable
   properties. For example, if L is a non-modular lattice, then <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> must be
   non-modular. In locally finite varieties, non-modular congruence lattices
   necessitate the presence of TCT types 1 or 5 [2 (Corollary 5.20)]. Thus, if a
   non-modular lattice LNM​ enforces the property "<span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> admits type 1 or type 5," then
   "G is a group such that <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> admits type 1 or 5 when LNM ≅ [H, G]" could be a
   candidate cf-IE property.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "empty tails" condition is an important qualifier. Properties like "<span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> omits
type 1 AND has empty tails for all its minimal sets" would be stronger and more
directly related to conditions like congruence modularity.3 The translation
bottleneck remains: how does an algebraic property of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (like "<span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> is congruence
modular") translate to a cf-IE group property of G?</p>
<h3 id="32-exploiting-geometric-constraints-in-labeled-congruence-lattices">3.2. Exploiting Geometric Constraints in Labeled Congruence Lattices</h3>
<p>The geometric configuration of prime quotients within <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A) ≅ L\)</span> imposes constraints on their TCT type labels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perspectivity and Projectivity</strong>. Two prime quotients I1​=I[α, β] and I2​=I[γ, δ]
   in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> are <strong>perspective</strong> if they are opposite sides of a diamond (M3
   configuration, e.g., α=γ∧δ and β=γ∨δ) or a pentagon (N5 configuration).
   <strong>Projectivity</strong> is a sequence of perspectivities. A fundamental result in TCT
   (often detailed in Chapter 6 of Hobby &amp; McKenzie, e.g., Lemmas 6.2--6.6) is that
   if two prime quotients are projective, they must have the same TCT type, provided
   certain conditions hold (e.g., the projectivity avoids type 1 quotients or the
   lattice is modular).2 This "type consistency under projectivity" is a powerful
   constraint.</li>
<li><strong>N5 (Pentagon) Subconfigurations</strong>. If L≅<span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> contains an N5 sublattice, then
   <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> is non-modular. This forces <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> to admit TCT types 1 or 5. The prime
   quotients forming the N5 configuration will be labeled accordingly, with at least
   one of them (often the critical quotient) being of type 1 or 5 [2 (Corollary
   5.20); 15].</li>
<li><strong>M3 (Diamond) Subconfigurations</strong>. If L≅<span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> contains an M3 sublattice, then
   <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> is non-distributive. If <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> were congruence distributive, it would omit
   types 1, 2, and 5. Therefore, the presence of an M3 implies that <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> is not
   congruence distributive, and thus must admit type 1, 2, or 5. Furthermore, if
   <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> is modular (which M3 itself is), types 1 and 5 are omitted from modular
   intervals unless specific conditions apply (related to solvability). A variety is
   congruence meet-semidistributive (SD(∧)) if and only if M3 is not embeddable in
   <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A)\)</span> for any A∈V; SD(∧) is equivalent to omitting types {1,2}.8 Thus, the
   presence of an M3 implies the variety is not SD(∧), meaning it must admit type 1
   or type 2. If the interval containing M3 is known to be modular, this would point
   towards type 2. The three covering quotients forming the "sides" of an M3 in a
   modular lattice are perspective and thus must have the same type (from {2,3,4}).</li>
</ul>
<p>These geometric constraints offer a direct mechanism for L to enforce TCT types on
<span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>. For example, if Ltarget​ contains an N5 configuration, then any group G
representing Ltarget​ as <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> must be such that <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> admits type 1 or 5. This
admission of "wilder" types becomes an algebraic property of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>, which then needs to
be translated into a cf-IE group property of G. The analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> in DeMeo's paper
implicitly uses such geometric reasoning; for instance, its non-modularity
contributes to the derived properties of G.</p>
<h3 id="33-the-role-of-solvableabelian-congruence-quotients-and-their-tct-type-correlates">3.3. The Role of Solvable/Abelian Congruence Quotients and their TCT Type Correlates</h3>
<p>The notions of solvability and abelianness for congruence quotients are deeply
connected to TCT types.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A prime quotient I[α, β] is <strong>abelian</strong> if the commutator [β, β] ≤ α. All type 2
   (affine) quotients are abelian. Type 1 (unary) quotients can be either abelian or
   non-abelian.2 Types 3, 4, and 5 are non-abelian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interval I[δ, θ] is <strong>solvable</strong> if it has a composition series where each
   prime factor is abelian. Consequently, if an interval is solvable, all its prime
   factors must be of type 1 or type 2 [2 (Theorem 7.12)].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the structure of a lattice L (when L ≅ <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>) forces certain intervals in
<span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> to be solvable, or certain prime quotients to be abelian (or non-abelian),
this imposes strict constraints on the TCT types present.  For instance, if L forces
a prime quotient in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> to be non-abelian, then that quotient cannot be of type 2
and, if type 1, must be a non-abelian type 1. DeMeo's result that insolubility of G
is IE [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] is an example of how such properties might connect; if <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> having only
solvable congruence quotients implied G is solvable, then a lattice L forcing a
non-solvable quotient in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> might enforce G's insolubility. This link between
the TCT commutator and group-theoretic solvability/nilpotency is a promising area for
defining cf-IE properties.</p>
<h2 id="4-assessing-the-combined-strategy-synergies-potential-and-challenges">4. Assessing the Combined Strategy: Synergies, Potential, and Challenges</h2>
<p>This section critically evaluates the feasibility and potential impact of the
combined DeMeo-TCT approach to the FLRP.</p>
<h3 id="41-potential-for-progress-the-path-to-contradiction">4.1. Potential for Progress: The Path to Contradiction</h3>
<p>The central strategy, as illuminated by DeMeo's Theorem 3.6 [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>], is to identify a
collection of cf-IE group properties whose intersection is empty. If such a
collection {Pj​} exists, then the FLRP would have a negative answer. Tame Congruence
Theory offers a powerful new toolkit to define candidate cf-IE properties.</p>
<p>The synergy unfolds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DeMeo's framework provides the overarching group-theoretic strategy and the
    parachute lattice construction as a conceptual tool for demonstrating how
    multiple cf-IE properties might be simultaneously forced upon a group G if FLRP
    has a positive answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCT provides a rich vocabulary of algebraic properties (Palg​) associated with the
    structure of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> (which is isomorphic to the lattice interval L ≅ [H, G]). 
    These properties are based on TCT types, type configurations, solvability,
    abelianness, and tail conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research objective is to translate these TCT-derived algebraic properties of
    <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> into group-theoretic properties (<span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​) of G, and then to prove that these <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​
    are indeed cf-IE, i.e., enforceable by some lattice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a set of such TCT-derived cf-IE group properties, possibly combined with known
cf-IE properties (like those from DeMeo's <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> analysis [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]), can be shown to be mutually
incompatible (i.e., their intersection is empty), then Theorem 3.6 (C) would lead to
a contradiction, implying FLRP has a negative answer. For example, one might find a
TCT-derived property P1​ (enforced by lattice L1′​) implying G has a highly non-abelian
structure, and another P2​ (enforced by L2′​) implying G has strong commutativity
properties. If P1​ and P2​ are incompatible, then the parachute lattice P(Lany​,L1′​,L2′​)
would be unrepresentable by any group as a core-free interval, falsifying statement
(B) of Pálfy-Pudlák.</p>
<p>A subtle but critical distinction must be maintained: a "forcing lattice" versus an
"enforcing lattice." A specific lattice Ltarget (e.g., <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> or a parachute lattice)
might, by its structure, <em>force</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (where Ltarget ≅ <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>) to exhibit certain TCT
characteristics, which in turn imply a group property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​ for G.  However, for <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​
to be a cf-IE property in DeMeo's sense, there must exist some lattice <span class="arithmatex">\(L\_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span>
(which could be different from Ltarget​) such that <em>any</em> group X representing <span class="arithmatex">\(L\_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span>
as a core-free interval [K, X] must possess property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​. This two-layered lattice
argumentation is essential for the logical integrity of applying Theorem 3.6. The
TCT-derived cf-IE properties are somewhat self-referential in this regard: the
"enforcing lattice" <span class="arithmatex">\(L_{P_i}\)</span> for a TCT-derived property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_i\)</span> would itself need to be a
lattice whose structure inherently forces specific TCT features on any algebra whose
congruence lattice it is.</p>
<p>DeMeo's analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>] already provides a set of potent cf-IE properties (G is
primitive, insoluble, <span class="arithmatex">\(C_G(N) = 1\)</span>, etc.). If TCT analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> (or other lattices) can
yield <em>new, independent</em> cf-IE properties of G, the intersection of required
properties shrinks, making a contradiction more attainable.  For instance, <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> is
non-modular, implying <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> must admit types 1 or 5; if this admission can be
translated into a new cf-IE group property not already covered by DeMeo's analysis,
progress is made.</p>

<h3 id="42-methodological-strengths">4.2. Methodological Strengths</h3>
<p>The proposed combination of DeMeo's enforceability framework with TCT offers
significant methodological advantages. TCT provides a systematic and deeply
structural way to analyze <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> (which is isomorphic to the given lattice interval
L). This goes beyond classical lattice theory, offering a classification of local
algebraic behaviors (the five types) and rules for how these types are distributed
within the congruence lattice (e.g., type preservation under projectivity,
constraints imposed by M3 or N5 subconfigurations) [[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>] (Lemmas 5.19,
6.2--6.6, 6.9, 6.10)].  The connection of TCT types to Malt'sev conditions and
congruence identities provides a rich source of strong algebraic constraints on <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>.6
DeMeo's framework, particularly Theorem 3.6, then provides the crucial linkage from
these (potentially new) algebraic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (if they can be translated into
group-theoretic terms) to the FLRP itself.  The Pálfy-Pudlák theorem, combined with
DeMeo's core-free condition, ensures that the TCT analysis of L ≅ <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> is directly
relevant to the FLRP.</p>
<h3 id="43-anticipated-hurdles-and-challenges">4.3. Anticipated Hurdles and Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the promise, several substantial hurdles must be overcome.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Translation Problem</strong>. The foremost challenge is translating algebraic
    properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> (the G-set ⟨G/H, ϕ(G)⟩), derived from TCT analysis of L ≅ <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>, 
    into meaningful and provably cf-IE <em>group-theoretic properties</em> of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>.
    For example, if TCT implies <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> must have a Taylor term (because <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> omits
    type 1), it is not immediately clear what specific structural property this
    imposes on <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> itself, nor how to prove that this <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span>-property is cf-IE by some other
    lattice. This step requires bridging universal algebra with group theory in a
    non-trivial way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proving cf-IE Nature</strong>. Even if a candidate group-theoretic property <span class="arithmatex">\(P\_{grp}\)</span>
    is derived from TCT considerations, proving it is cf-IE (i.e., finding a lattice
    <span class="arithmatex">\(L\_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span> that enforces <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​ on any group X representing
    <span class="arithmatex">\(L\_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span>​ as a core-free interval) is a significant task.  DeMeo's
    paper provides examples, but each such proof is a research result in its own
    right.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Complexity of TCT:</strong> TCT is a highly technical and intricate theory. Correctly
    applying its full depth to derive robust enforceable properties, and then
    translating these, requires profound expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrating Empty Intersection:</strong> The ultimate goal of finding a collection
     of cf-IE group properties whose intersection is provably empty remains a grand
     challenge in group theory. TCT may help identify new candidate properties, but
     the final proof of an empty intersection is a group-theoretic problem.</li>
<li><strong>Group Representability of Enforcing Lattices:</strong> For a TCT-derived cf-IE
     property to be useful in DeMeo's strategy (e.g., Conjecture 3.1 regarding a
     property and its negation [<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]), the lattice
     <span class="arithmatex">\(L\_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span>​ that enforces it must itself be "group representable"
     (isomorphic to an interval in some group's subgroup lattice). Establishing this
     for potentially complex lattices arising from TCT considerations may not be
     straightforward.</li>
</ol>
<p>The path from the TCT properties of Con(G/H) to cf-IE properties of G is the most
critical and least explored part of this proposed strategy. It requires a deep
understanding of how the action of G on G/H reflects back onto the structure of G
itself, in a way that is conditionable by lattice interval structures.</p>

<h3 id="51-overall-assessment-of-the-combined-strategys-promise">5.1. Overall Assessment of the Combined Strategy's Promise</h3>
<p>The strategy of integrating Tame Congruence Theory with DeMeo's framework of
enforceable properties offers a novel and potentially powerful approach to the Finite
Lattice Representation Problem.  TCT provides a sophisticated lens to analyze the
structure of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> (where <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> is the algebra whose congruence lattice is isomorphic
to the given interval [H, G]), potentially revealing algebraic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> that
were previously inaccessible.  DeMeo's Theorem 3.6 provides a clear pathway: if a
collection of cf-IE group properties can be found whose intersection is empty, the
FLRP would be negatively resolved.  The primary promise of the combined strategy lies
in TCT's ability to furnish new candidate algebraic properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>, which, if
successfully translated into cf-IE group properties of G, could enrich the set of
constraints applicable under Theorem 3.6, thereby increasing the chances of finding
such an empty intersection.</p>
<p>The strength of this combined approach is its multi-layered attack, leveraging the
Pálfy-Pudlák theorem to connect the abstract lattice problem to group theory, DeMeo's
framework to define enforceability within group theory, and TCT to provide deep
structural insights into the congruence lattices that bridge these domains.</p>
<h3 id="52-recommendations-for-specific-research-directions">5.2. Recommendations for Specific Research Directions</h3>
<p>To realize the potential of this combined strategy, future research should focus on several key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Translation Problem</strong>. This is the most critical research direction.
    Methodologies need to be developed to rigorously translate TCT-derived properties
    of the algebra <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> = ⟨G/H, ϕ(G)⟩ (such as omitting specific TCT types, satisfying
    certain Malt'sev conditions, or having specific local congruence geometries) into
    well-defined group-theoretic properties of G. This involves understanding how the
    structure of the G-set G/H and its TCT characteristics reflect back onto the
    intrinsic structure of G.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question</strong>. If <span class="arithmatex">\(V(A_G)\)</span> is a Taylor variety (omits type 1), what does this imply
   about the normal subgroup structure, solvability, or permutational properties
   of <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> itself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question</strong>. If <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span> is congruence modular 
   (implying <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{typ}(V(A_G)) ⊆ {2,3,4}\)</span> and empty tails), 
   what restrictions does this place on <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> (e.g., related to G being
   solvable, or having specific types of chief factors)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying and Proving cf-IE Nature of TCT-Derived Group Properties</strong>. 
    Once a group property <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​ is hypothesized from TCT analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span>, it
    must be proven to be cf-IE.  This requires finding a lattice
    <span class="arithmatex">\(L_{\mathrm{enforce}}\)</span>​ such that <span class="arithmatex">\(L_{\mathrm{enforce}} ​≅ [K, X]\)</span> (<span class="arithmatex">\(K\)</span> core-free)
    implies <span class="arithmatex">\(X ⊨ P_{grp}\)</span>​. This may involve constructing specific lattices whose
    structure inherently forces the desired TCT behavior on any algebra representing
    them, which in turn forces <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{grp}\)</span>​.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploiting Geometric Constraints in Labeled Congruence Lattices</strong>.
    A systematic investigation into how specific lattice configurations (e.g., M3,
    N5, more complex patterns of perspectivity or projectivity within
    <span class="arithmatex">\(L ≅ \mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>) force particular TCT type assignments or type omissions
    is needed. The rules from Hobby &amp; McKenzie's Chapter 6 on labeled congruence
    lattices are foundational here.[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>. If a lattice L contains projective prime quotients I1​ and I2​,
TCT implies typ(I1​) = typ(I2​) (under suitable conditions).  Can this type
equality, for specific types forced by L's structure, be translated into a cf-IE
property of G?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-analysis of Critical Lattices (e.g., <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>)</strong>. Apply a full TCT analysis to
    lattices like <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>.  DeMeo's analysis of <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span> derived several cf-IE
    properties.[<a href="#works-cited">1</a>]  TCT might reveal further constraints on
    <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G) ≅ L_7\)</span> (e.g., specific type occurrences due to its
    non-modularity or M3 sublattices) which could translate into additional cf-IE
    properties of G, potentially strengthening the argument for <span class="arithmatex">\(L_7\)</span>'s
    non-representability or leading to a contradiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigating the "Empty Tails" Condition</strong>. The property that "<span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> has only
    empty-tailed minimal sets (for certain types)" is a strong structural condition
    linked to congruence modularity.<a href="#works-cited">3</a>  Research should explore if
    this condition, or aspects of it, can be translated into a cf-IE group property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commutator Theory and TCT Types</strong>. The relationship between solvable/abelian
    congruence quotients (defined via the commutator) and TCT types 1 and 2 is
    well-established.[<a href="#works-cited">2</a>]  If a lattice L forces certain
    commutator-theoretic properties on <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\)</span>, this implies restrictions
    on types 1 and 2. This could lead to cf-IE properties related to the derived
    series or nilpotency class of G.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Progress in these directions, particularly in systematically bridging the gap between
TCT properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(A_G\)</span> and cf-IE properties of G, holds the most promise for
leveraging this combined strategy to make significant advancements on the Finite
Lattice Representation Problem. A "negative" TCT result, such as identifying a TCT
type-labeling pattern that is impossible for any finite congruence lattice, could
also be impactful if a group interval representation were shown to necessitate such a
pattern.</p>
