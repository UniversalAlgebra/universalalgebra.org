Core-Free Interval Enforceable (cf-IE) Properties: Definitions and Significance","text":"<p>In  [1], building upon the P\u00e1lfy-Pudl\u00e1k theorem, DeMeo introduces a classification of group-theoretic properties based on their relationship to lattice intervals. An \"interval enforceable (IE)\" property \\(P\\) is a group property for which there exists a finite lattice \\(L\\) such that if \\(G\\) is a group with \\(L\\) isomorphic to an interval \\([H, G]\\) in its subgroup lattice \\(\\mathrm{Sub}(G)\\), then \\(G\\) must possess property \\(P\\).</p> <p>A more refined and crucial concept for the FLRP is that of \"core-free interval enforceable (cf-IE)\" properties.  A property \\(P\\) is cf-IE if there exists a finite lattice \\(L\\) such that if \\(G\\) is a group with \\(L \u2245 [H, G]\\) and \\(H\\) is a core-free subgroup of \\(G\\) (i.e., \\(\\mathrm{core}_G(H) = 1\\), meaning \\(H\\) contains no non-trivial normal subgroup of \\(G\\)), then \\(G\\) must possess property \\(P\\).[1]</p> <p>The core-free condition, \\(\\mathrm{core}_G(H) = 1\\), is of paramount significance.  When \\(H\\) is core-free in \\(G\\), the group \\(G\\) admits a faithful permutation representation \\(\u03d5\\) on the set of right cosets \\(G/H\\). It is a well-established result that the congruence lattice of the algebra \\(\u27e8G/H, \u03d5(G)\u27e9\\) (formed by the \\(G\\)-set \\(G/H\\) with the action of \\(G\\)) is isomorphic to the interval \\([H, G]\\) in \\(\\mathrm{Sub}(G)\\). </p> <p>This isomorphism is the critical link: it means that a core-free interval \\([H, G]\\) is the congruence lattice of a specific finite algebra derived directly from the group \\(G\\) and subgroup \\(H\\). Consequently, cf-IE properties are group properties that are forced upon \\(G\\) when a particular lattice \\(L\\) appears as the congruence lattice of such a \\(G\\)-set. This directly connects the study of subgroup intervals under the core-free condition to statement (A) of the P\u00e1lfy-Pudl\u00e1k theorem, making cf-IE properties particularly potent tools for investigating the FLRP. Without the core-free assumption, the interval \\([H, G]\\) might not directly correspond to a congruence lattice of an algebra naturally derived from \\(G\\) in a way that is immediately relevant to the FLRP as formulated by P\u00e1lfy and Pudl\u00e1k.</p> <p>DeMeo [1] provides several examples of cf-IE properties. Insolubility is shown to be IE (and therefore cf-IE), while solubility is demonstrated to be not even cf-IE.  Other identified cf-IE classes of groups include those that are not alternating or symmetric groups, subdirectly irreducible groups, groups possessing no non-trivial abelian normal subgroups, and groups \\(G\\) for which the centralizer \\(C_G(M)\\) is trivial for every non-trivial normal subgroup \\(M\\) of \\(G\\). These examples underscore that cf-IE properties can be substantial and non-trivial, offering a way to impose strong structural constraints on groups based on the lattice-theoretic structure of their subgroup intervals.</p>"},{"location":"flrp/deep/#13-strategic-importance-of-thm-36-and-the-parachute-construction-for-flrp","title":"1.3. Strategic Importance of Thm 3.6 and the Parachute Construction for FLRP","text":"<p>A cornerstone of DeMeo's proposed strategy for the FLRP is Theorem 3.6 of [1].

This, in turn, would imply that statement (B) of the P\u00e1lfy-Pudl\u00e1k theorem is false, leading to a negative resolution of the FLRP.[1] This transforms the FLRP into a concrete group-theoretic problem: the search for a set of mutually incompatible cf-IE properties.</p> <p>The \"parachute lattice\" construction, denoted \\(P(L, L_1, ..., L_n)\\) (Figure 4 of [1] and reproduced below), is a key technical device used in proving the equivalence (B) \u27f9 (C).

If statement (B) holds, then \\(P\\) must be representable as a core-free interval \\([H, G]\\) for some group \\(G\\).  The structure of the parachute lattice then ensures that the sub-intervals within \\([H, G]\\) corresponding to \\(L_i\\) are also core-free intervals isomorphic to \\(L_i\\). Consequently, \\(G\\) must possess each property \\(P_i\\), placing \\(G\\) in the intersection \\(\u22c2 P_i\\).

When tails are empty, the local structure is fully \"tame,\" and the analytical power of TCT can be most effectively applied. The presence of non-empty tails, especially for types 1 or 5, is intrinsically linked to failures of congruence modularity. For instance, if a minimal set of type i \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5} has a non-empty tail, it forces the existence of a pentagonal sublattice N5 (a hallmark of non-modularity) of type i in the congruence lattice of some subalgebra of \\(A^2\\).

If a lattice \\(L\\), interpreted as \\(\\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\\), were to force \\(A_G\\) to have minimal sets with non-empty tails of type 1 or 5, this would indicate a certain \"wildness\" in \\(A_G\\) and imply that \\(V(A_G)\\) is not congruence modular.

Projectivity is a sequence of perspectivities. A fundamental result in TCT    (often detailed in Chapter 6 of Hobby &amp; McKenzie, e.g., Lemmas 6.2--6.6) is that    if two prime quotients are projective, they must have the same TCT type, provided    certain conditions hold (e.g., the projectivity avoids type 1 quotients or the    lattice is modular).2 This \"type consistency under projectivity\" is a powerful    constraint.</li> <li>N5 (Pentagon) Subconfigurations.

Furthermore, if    \\(\\mathrm{Con}(A_G)\\) is modular (which M3 itself is), types 1 and 5 are omitted from modular    intervals unless specific conditions apply (related to solvability). A variety is    congruence meet-semidistributive (SD(\u2227)) if and only if M3 is not embeddable in    \\(\\mathrm{Con}(A)\\) for any A\u2208V; SD(\u2227) is equivalent to omitting types {1,2}.8 Thus, the    presence of an M3 implies the variety is not SD(\u2227), meaning it must admit type 1    or type 2. If the interval containing M3 is known to be modular, this would point    towards type 2.
